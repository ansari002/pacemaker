Pacemaker Simulation
A pacemaker is a small device that's placed in the chest or abdomen to help control abnormal 
heart rhythms. This device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate.
Synchronous task
• Monitoring heartbeat rate at a steady rate of 2 seconds after each reading.
Asynchronous task
• Whenever there is an abnormal heartbeat rhythm, an electrical impulse is triggered to 
normalize the heartbeat.
